# What This Variable Does (WTVD)

Do you imagine beign able to find the documentation of your project just by putting the name of the variable that you want to backtrack? So now is possible with this program made in GO.

Made with frustration by: xsami :computer:


## How to run

Just need to download install the dependecies and build the main project. After that from the command line interface you must specify the absolute path of the project ex: `/home/username/Dektop/MyprojectName` and boom baby thats all you need to do to make this baby run.

You can download the package realease for the project so don't need to be compiling and installing this project as it is made in golang.


## Report a bug or contribute with a language

Just make a new branch and ask for the PR. I'll be trying to define most of the language that I can but really appreciate the contribution of any GO developer to make this repository usefull. In my case the main purpose is for the language used in my work: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINC_4GL. Enjoy this language.
